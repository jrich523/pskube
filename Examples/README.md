You are able to Extend over override any of this via custom classes for format files.

There are two examples on how to extend this module

# Format Files

You can easily customize how the objects are displayed by messing with Format Files. There is a format file included in the module that you can look at for other examples, but i've included a simple one to get started with.

Documentation for Format files can be found here

# Custom Classes
Ideally if you'd like to add a custom class its to better expose an object type and in that case if you do create it, submitting a pull request to get it included in the module itself would be ideal!
